	<h3>The Far</h3>
	  <h1>Beyond</h1>
	  <p class="solarsystem">The planetary system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
	
		Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury,
		Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions
		of asteroids, comets and meteoroids.
	
		Beyond our own solar system, there are more planets than stars in night sky. So far, we have discovered thousands
		of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way, with more planets being found all the time. Most of
		the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy are thought to have planets of their own, and the Milky Way is but
		one of perhaps 100 billion galaxies in the universe.
	
		While our planet is in some ways a mere speck in the vast cosmos, we have a lot of company out there. It seems
		that we live in a universe packed with planets — a web of countless stars accompanied by families of objects,
		perhaps some with life of their own.</p>

	<div class="item-2"><p>There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current count orbiting our star: eight.
			The inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.
			Beyond Neptune, a newer class of smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including perennial favorite Pluto.This seemingly simple question doesn't 
			have a simple answer. Everyone knows that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets. But both Pluto and Ceres were once considered planets until new discoveries 
			triggered scientific debate about how to best describe them—a vigorous debate that continues to this day. The most recent definition of a planet was adopted
			 by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. It says a planet must do three things:</p>
			<ul >
			<li class="item-2"> It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun).</li>
			<li class="item-2">It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.</li>
			<li class="item-2">It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun.</li>

		<p class="description"> Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around
		the Sun takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman

        		harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
       			Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's
        		only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days, a period known as an Earth sidereal
        		year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 365.256 times. </p>
